      "In this episode, we discuss the trait that runs in the Bajaj family for generations, having a long history of feuds. Brother vs Brother, Father vs Son, Uncles vs Nephews, and Family vs outsiders. This story probably has more masala than a Bollywood movie. We will specifically discuss Rahul Bajaj's feud with his nephew and brother, Rahul Bajaj v/s NK Firodia and Rahul Bajaj v/s Rajiv Bajaj.",

      "Not a year goes by when the Indian government does not show up the plans to invite a bid for Air India and divest its stake in it. Once, a remarkable airline symbol of luxury and the pride of India is today amongst the worst in the business. Started in 1932 as Tata Airlines, it was not only profitable but reckoned as a symbol of luxury globally. Today, no one views Air India so highly. What happened with Air India? What led it to its current state?",

      "50,000 new houses are constructed everyday in India and atleast 80,000 undergo renovation. If there is one industry that directly benefits from the sheer scale of the Indian housing market, it would be the Paints Industry. This industry has been undisputably been dominated by a company for not 1, not 2 but 5 decades, its Asian Paints. How exactly has Asian Paints retained its throne for so long, listen to know why.",

      "In this episode, we discuss how when everyone was busy becoming a dot-com, Google solved the problem of search. When everyone wanted to be a search engine, Facebook came as a medium to network. When companies get trapped in recency bias, their future prospects become instantly bleak. Netflix, Uber, Tesla, Youtube, Whatsapp and Airbnb didn’t meander in the ideas of the present, let alone the past, rather they emphasised solving today’s problems with next-generation technologies; they ‘thought further out’!

      "In this episode, we discuss how in February 2019, Elon said the bitcoin structure is quite brilliant but he didn’t know how to use it at Tesla since it was energy-intensive and went against Tesla’s motto of sustainable energy. Fast forward to March 2021, when bitcoin’s energy usage had almost quadrupled, he proudly tweeted: “You can now buy a Tesla with Bitcoin”.  Again fast-forward two months, he makes a U-turn on his announcement. So is Musk Genius Billionaire Playboy Hypocrite? Tune in to listen more!",

      "In this episode, we discuss how during the 2008 great financial crisis, the world saw the house of cards that the US financial market crumbled down to ashes.” It is 2021 and the trust in the central banks and the governments of the world still hasn’t totally recovered from this blow. The need of the hour was an asset class that would be decentralized, independent of the authority of institutions, and also generate great returns for its investors. Hail Bitcoin!

      "In this episode, we discuss how you shall not let central banks, governments or the greatest investor of all time (you know who) tell you that Bitcoin is a scam. When traditional institutions have failed us in this medical crisis, blockchain technology, if implemented, could have saved the day and the dead. A publicly distributed ledger could have helped drug makers, distributors, equipment manufacturers, hospitals & patients to be on one platform & search for their dependencies in lesser time and with greater accuracy.
